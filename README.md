# üö® Make sure you have added this file to the .gitignore file.

# App
NODE_ENV=

# DB
POSTGRES_DB=myDb                                      # Whatever you want.
POSTGRES_USER=myUser                                  # Whatever you want.
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myPassword                          # Whatever you want.
POSTGRES_HOME_DIR=/my/local/path/data/                # Your Local path to be linked with the docker volume.
POSTGRES_PORT=5432                                    # Whatever you want.
POSTGRES_URL=`postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@localhost:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}?schema=public`
```
<br>

#### 2) Navigate to `.gitignore` and uncomment the .env glob at the bottom of the file.
```bash
# Env files
# üö® Be sure to uncomment the comments below. (# .env -> .env)
.env

<br>

#### 3) Run the command below to execute the `docker-compose.db.yml` file and quickly launch PostgreSQL locally.
